Welcome!

I'm building this app to help me keep track of all the loot and real estate gathered in my D&D campaign now running over two years strong. 

Using this Rails --API backend  I will keep track of my character's Bag of Holding, as well as deeds to various properties and weath stored in each property. 

Current values and weight will be kept standard using one of the available DND 5e apis, which I will document after I decide which one to use. 

This is open source so please feel free to clone anything you like. If you would like to reach out, shoot me an email at joshuagauthreaux@gmail.com, or you can reach me through my website, joshgotro.com. 

Thanks!
